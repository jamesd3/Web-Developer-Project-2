## Udacity Front End Web Developer Project 2
###By James DeLapa III

Note: This project was completed (for the most part) when I was working on project 3 for the full stack web developer nanodegree.
* **I added the front end web developer nanodegree and as a result this project needs to be turned in.
* **Some portions of the project were edited recently simply because I was not satisfied with my original design.

### Project Summary:
The resume is supposed to look similar to this:

And the repository includes the following files:

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* **js/helper.js**: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. Functionality was added by me per the assignment.
* **js/resumeBuilder.js**: This is the file where all the code written within was done so by me.
* **js/jQuery.js**: The jQuery library.
* **css/style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.
* **README.md**:
The GitHub readme file.
* and some images in the images directory.
